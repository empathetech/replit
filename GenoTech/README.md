# Welcome to GenoTech

Hello there, welcome to GenoTech! We're thrilled to have you on board. As you know, our mission here is to make genetic information universally accessible and useful. 

## What We Do

One of our core products is our DNA Analysis Software, a powerful tool that enables researchers and doctors to analyze, filter, and match specific genome sequences based on various search criteria. Today, I'd like to discuss a challenge that we're currently facing.

The human genome is a complex structure composed of approximately 3 billion DNA base pairs. To efficiently analyze these vast amounts of data, we need to develop an algorithm that can efficiently search and match specific genome sequences based on a given set of criteria. 

## Your Challenge

Your challenge is to design and implement a function that allows users to input a search string representing a DNA sequence (for simplicity, this will be a string composed of 'A', 'T', 'C', and 'G' representing Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine, and Guanine respectively), and the function should return all the matches within a provided genome sequence.

The matching should be exact, meaning the search sequence should match the part of the genome sequence exactly in the same order. Also, we want the function to return the starting index of each match within the genome sequence. The genome sequences can be quite long, even millions of characters, and there can be multiple search strings at once, so the function needs to be as efficient as possible. 

The scope of your task will be strictly algorithmic - don't worry about the UI or database integration for now. Focus on the core functionality and make sure your solution is both efficient and accurate. We're looking forward to seeing what you come up with!
