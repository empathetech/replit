# Empathetech Vanilla JS Interview Prompts

Hey there! Welcome to the main page for Empathetech's Vanilla JS Interview Prompts. 

## Folder Organization

This Replit is organized into named, `CapsCase` subfolders representing individual interview prompts with READMEs, function signatures, and light testing, as well as a `utils` subfolder to help with some of the scaffolding around interview prep.

## How Do I Use This?
Fork this Replit and spin it up on your end. We've reserved the main `index.js` file so that you can import a specific interview prompt by navigating the subfolders in this Replit and their associated tests. The parent `index.js` will hopefully always show one example of importing the function signature and test implementations.


## Maintainers

Interview problems are either handrolled by our Empathetech volunteers or prompted and edited from ChatGPT in order to provide free alternatives and a greater diversity of practice around code challenges for data structures and algorithm style interviews. While this is a Node.js Replit, you can likely apply any of these problems to a vanilla implementation of your language du jour (we simply picked this language since most of the folks in our community currently started their software journey in JS).
